// Question 10:Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one
// comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too
// simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file.
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does

// Add the numbers
let num1 = 10;
let num2 =20;
let sum = num1 + num2
//now we will print 
console.log(sum) ;
